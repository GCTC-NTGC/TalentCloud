1. Prepare dependencies:
composer i --no-dev --optimize-autoloader && npm run prod && npm ci --production

2. Update the DATE_MODIFIED string in app/Http/ViewComposers/FooterComposer.php

3. Zip the TalentCloud folder, copy to server on TBS device.

4. WinSCP deploy.sh and deploy_talentcloud.sh and TalentCloud.zip to your home directory.

5. Set permissions and execute:
sudo chmod 775 deploy.sh
sudo chmod 775 deploy_talentcloud.sh
sudo ./deploy_talentcloud.sh



To deploy the Reserve app instead:
Same as above, except the zipped folder should be named TalentReserve.zip, and run ./deploy_reserve.sh instead.

To deploy to the dev server:
Same as above, except use deploy_dev_reserve.sh and deploy_dev_talentcloud.sh scripts.
