If your application is strong, you might be considered for an interview or asked to complete a take-home exam. Let’s say you do really well, but you just narrowly miss out on the job. We think there is value in that success and we’re working towards recognizing that.\n\nWe want to make it possible for managers to give a credential, or a badge, to those who pass assessments (like a take home test) even if they don’t get the job. If you get one of these credentials you could present it in future applications and managers could choose whether to accept it in place of doing a similar test again.\n\nLet’s say you do get the job, you demonstrate the skills you said you have and gain some new ones. Your manager could give you credentials for the skills you demonstrated on the job at the end of your term. Think of it as a new type of job reference that doesn’t need an email or a phone call.\n\nWe’re still working out the details, but are committed to making sure your credentials are owned by you and that you’re able to use them both inside, and outside government.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more, check out our proof-of-concept issuing %certs%.",
