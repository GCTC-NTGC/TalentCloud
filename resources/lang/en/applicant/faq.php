But with the rise of the internet, a different type of employment has emerged to keep pace with the new economies unlocked by the digital age. Sometimes called “gig”, project-based or non-traditional employment, this new work category now accounts for almost 30% of employment in Canada and the United States, with similar increases in Europe. But despite the staggering growth in project-based work, governments haven’t adapted their hiring models.",

To make this work, applicants need a platform that lets them find opportunities and be valued in different ways, and managers need a staffing model optimized for the digital age. While the Government of Canada has had “term” workers for a long time, this is the first public sector talent model created - from tech to behavioural design - to enable a thriving marketplace for project-based work."

For the initial experiment, applicants should expect to hear back about their initial application within 2 weeks of the job advertisement closing. For those moving on to further rounds of screening in a position that has been advertised as bilingual, expect language testing early in the process. (If you have never taken any language testing with the Government of Canada before, you may want to try these <a href='https://www.canada.ca/en/public-service-commission/services/second-language-testing-public-service/self-assessment-tests.html' title'Take the tests.'>self-assessment tests</a> to get a sense of what the tests are like.)",

This can take a while, as it depends on procedural timelines of the country you’ve lived in. Applicants can request this “out of country” criminal record check at any time, outside of any staffing process. This record is submitted from the applicant to the Government of Canada at the time of security screening. So if you’ve spent 8 months in South Africa or hung out in the Alps for a year or been at school in Australia, we suggest requesting your records up front. This can save you and your hiring manager a lot of time later. (And if a particular project-based position starts at fixed date, the lack of security clearance in time may force the hiring manager to select another candidate…)"

All these extra applications block up the system and slow down staffing to a painfully slow pace. Talent Cloud shares a lot more information with applicants about the position and the hiring manager to help applicants be part of the discussion on right fit.
