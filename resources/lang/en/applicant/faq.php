The internet has unlocked new economies as well as a rise in project-based or non-traditional employment. Sometimes called the \"gig\" economy, employees in this new category of work now account for almost 30% of employment in Canada and the United States, with similar trends in Europe. Despite this seismic shift, governments haven\'t adapted their hiring models.',

To make this work, applicants need a platform that lets them find opportunities and easily demonstrate their value, and managers need an efficient and scalable staffing model optimized for the digital age. While the Government of Canada has had "term" workers for a long time, this is the first public sector talent model created to enable a thriving marketplace for project-based work.'

For those who move past the initial screening in a position that has been advertised as bilingual, expect language testing early in the process. (If you have never taken any language testing with the Government of Canada before, you may want to try these <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-service-commission/services/second-language-testing-public-service/self-assessment-tests.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Take the tests">self-assessment tests</a> to get a sense of what the tests are like).',

This can take a while, as it depends on the processing timelines of the country you\'ve lived in. Applicants can request this "out of country" criminal record check at any time and the request doesn\'t need to be linked to a staffing process. This record is submitted from the applicant to the Government of Canada at the time of security screening. So if you\'ve spent 8 months in South Africa or hung out in the Alps for a year or been at school in Australia, we suggest requesting your records up front. This can save you and your hiring manager a lot of time later.
