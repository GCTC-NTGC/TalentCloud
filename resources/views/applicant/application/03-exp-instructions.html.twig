            <p data-c-margin="bottom(1)">In a similar fashion to your resume, the next step in your application is telling us about your experiences. Unlike your resume, we want you to tell us about everything that has helped you hone your craft in relation to this job.</p>
            <p data-c-margin="bottom(1)">On Talent Cloud, you can add experiences of these types:</p>
            <ul data-c-margin="bottom(1)">
                <li>Education Experience</li>
                <li>Work Experience</li>
                <li>Community Experience</li>
                <li>Personal Experience</li>
                <li>Awards</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The best part is that as you add these experiences, the information gets saved to your profile. The next time you go to apply to a job, you'll be able to select from the same work you've done to help speed up the process.</p>
