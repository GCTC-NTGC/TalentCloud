You may get called up immediately or you may not get called at all. We’ll also let you know when you’re no longer needed in reserve, so you’re not left wondering. While you’re in this pool, please make sure to ((email the team)) if you have to withdraw your name for any reason. We want to make sure we only send the names of people currently available to departments in need.</p>

If it’s really not for you, you can withdraw your name from the reserve list at that time. But the expectation is that you’ll end up helping out on a new team for a bit. The opportunity will be an at-level arrangement, and may be informal in nature. Your home and host departments will coordinate to make this happen. If you do go, drop us a line and let us know how it went. We collect user stories and we’re interested in learning how to improve the process for next time.</p>
